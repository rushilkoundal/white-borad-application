# White Board Application

Online white board application built using react.js and canvasAPI.

Online tutoring and schooling from home are
becoming very common nowadays. Moreover,
because of the COVID pandemic, brainstorming and
discussing ideas over video calls have picked up in
popularity as well.

In such cases, whiteboards play an important part in
making these tasks simple. With a whiteboard, you
can easily explain and share ideas. Having a digital
whiteboard solves the problem of purchasing and
installing a physical one.
